    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:     37
      Number with same-slice register load:     35
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   983 out of   1,430   68%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       132 out of   2,860    4%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,869
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           780 out of   1,869   41%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              36 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
